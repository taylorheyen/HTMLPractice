    <h1>Taylor's Blog</h1>
    <p><strong>Welcome</strong> to my blog!</p>
    <p>I am very excited to start blogging a building my website here.
        We are in the process of learning how to do HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        This is the start of it all!

    <h2>What to Know</h2>
    <p>
        This blog will have a lot of <em>random</em> words and phrases because I am just trying to learn HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript.
